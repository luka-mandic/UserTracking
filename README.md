# User tracking software

A simple application that gathers data about the users that visit it.

The following data is gathered:

<ul>
	<li>IP address</li>
	<li>Browser</li>
	<li>Browser version</li>
	<li>Operating system</li>
	<li>Country</li>
	<li>City</li>
	<li>Number of visits</li>
</ul>

Note: if you are running this on localhost, then the application won't be able to get your proper IP address.

In order for get_browser() to work, your browscap configuration setting in php.ini must point to the correct location of the browscap.ini file on your system.
browscap.ini is not bundled with PHP, but you may find an up-to-date php_browscap.ini file here:
http://browscap.org/
